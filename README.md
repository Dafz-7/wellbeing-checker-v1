# Wellbeing-Checker-V1
A desktop app made in python that:
  1. Summarizes your wellbeing throughout the month and ongoing, in the form of statistics and AI's opinion.
  2. Helps you recall your best and worst memories.


# Features in V1
  1. Accepts user input for a diary.
  2. A time limit of how much the app has opened for, to NOT be a distraction instead. This app is only for short diary input.
     - for example, the limit to open the app is 15 mins, beyond that the app is closed automatically and can't be opened until tomorrow's session.
     - you can technically open after the timer has finished, but you can't type anything (you can still log in / sign up).
  3.  A setting page where you can set up your time limit for the app (30 minutes MAX).
