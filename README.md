# Wellbeing Checker

Wellbeing Checker is an application that lets you make a short diary about your whole day, every day. Eventually, after a month, the app will analyse your moods and generate recommendations about how to improve your mood, and this cycle continues indefinitely.

I find making this app important because not all people can do self‑evaluation on their own or find it hard, and this is when the app comes into play. By getting monthly summaries of how their days go through the month, people who have this app can reflect upon themselves — which day they are the most happy, normal, or sad. By simply viewing the summary, people will automatically reflect on how to nourish things that make them happy, and figure out how to get rid of things that make them sad or even heartbroken. Hopefully, by making this app, people who download this app can see through themselves better as a person.

## Features

Here are the currently implemented features available in the app:

- **Daily diary entry**  
  Users can write a short diary every day about their day.

- **Mood tracking**  
  Each diary entry has mood results (`very happy`, `happy`, `normal`, `sad`, `very sad`) to build a history of moods throughout the month.

- **Monthly summary**  
  At the end of each month, the app generates a summary and a graph showing how the user’s mood has changed.

- **Recommendations (AI integration)**  
  In the monthly summary section, at the very bottom, there is a recommendation generated by AI, letting the user reflect on how to improve their life in the upcoming months.  
  > AI used is from the Ollama local model (Mistral), and must be installed before opening this app.

- **Simple user interface**  
  Minimal distraction design so the user can focus only on writing diary entries.

- **Session time limit**  
  The app has a time limit of maximum 30 minutes. This helps the user not be distracted by the app since it was made for mood tracking and diary entry.  
  > This setting can be changed in the settings page inside the app.

- **Local database storage**  
  Every diary entry and settings (session time limit) are saved to the database (`SQLite`, with the name `wellbeing.db`).  
  > Because it’s local, users can change the insides of the database `wellbeing.db` however they want, though it’s not recommended.
